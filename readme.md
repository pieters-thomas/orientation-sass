#Orientation Time

Below you will find a lot of links to documentation / demonstrations and exercises to play around with. This should help you to make a decision to go for the front- or backend trajectory. The resources are divided in 4 categories.

Nor in the frontend, neither the backend trajectory will you be coached on EACH piece of information you will find here. You can come up to the coaches if you need some guidance with any of the topics. It's your responsibility to go as far as you can! (Especially during the summer pastures)

Don't be mistaken though, to get hired as a junior intern you do NOT need to know everything listed below.

My advice is to experiment with a couple of resources from the frontend AND the backend resources. For frontend, I recommend playing around with gulp, angular and css preprocessors. For Backend, I recommend playing around with Symfony, twig and doctrine.

1. Frontend
2. Backend
3. Useful terminology
4. Design patterns

The last 2 categories I recommend investing yourselves in when you are starting to contact companies. These are useful for theoretic understanding and tackling interview questions. If however you really want to check out some design patterns right now, I have categorised the ones I found easier to understand than others.
